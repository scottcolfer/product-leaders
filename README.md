# Product Leaders Community

This is a site to promote the Good Product Leaders Community

## Built with thanks to

- [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) - text formatting syntax used when writing content
- [Minimal](https://github.com/pages-themes/minimal) - used as the theme for the site
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - generates the site
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) - free hosting for the website

## Contributing

No obvious need for contributors right now. If a code of conduct becomes useful then I'll probably use something like the [contributor covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).
