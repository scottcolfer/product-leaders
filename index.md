# Product Leaders Community

**The largest network of its kind in the UK, we are a mix of over 100 product leaders from Central Government, Local Government, Higher Education, Healthcare, and Charities.** 

**Register [here](https://forms.gle/VLWA68ovMXHWA7AM6).**

We use a WhatsApp Community to keep in touch and elp each other out, along with online and real world meetups. Anyone wanting to join with a title of Lead Product Manager, Principle Product Manager, Head of Product, Assistant Director of Product, Director of Product, or Chief Product Offier is immediately approved. For others we review their application. We donâ€™t want to be purist around roles - we do want this to be a safe space for people with similar challenges and opportunities. Our priority is for Leads and above to have a safe space to be vulnerable away from folks they manage.
