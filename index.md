Product leaders need safe spaces to share and learn from one another. But we don’t have many of these spaces. Public sector product leaders are especially poorly served, with a lot of stuff aimed at commercial sector. I took a punt and shared a LinkedIn post inviting folks to join this new thing, figuring we might get 10-20 interested. We quickly got to 50+ folks and it continues to grow.

# Why

I’ve hit the public sector trifecta of Central Govt, Local Govt and Charity product leadership roles and realised we all have the same problems and same opportunities. I’ve been working in Higher Education rcently and the same is true. My personal aim is for us to have a safe space. And somewhere to support the next generation of product leaders.

# Membership

Anyone wanting to join with a title of Lead Product Manager, Principle Product Manager, Head of Product, Assistant Director of Product, Director of Product, or Chief Product Offier is immediately approved. For others we review their application. We don’t want to be purist around roles - we do want this to be a safe space for people with similar challenges and opportunities. Our priority is for Leads and up to have a safe space to be vulnerable away from folks they manage.

# Who

We are a mix of product leaders from Central Government, Local Government, Higher Education, Healthcare, and Charities. I’m facilitating the community to get it off the ground. I’m doing this as me, Scott Colfer. [Herd Consulting](https://herd.consulting/), where I work, is sponsoring this by allowing me to do it ‘on the clock’. And have agreed there is nothing expected in return, it’s simply a way of accomplishing our social mission to support the professions of product management and business analysis. 

# How 

We use [WhatsApp Comunity](https://www.whatsapp.com/community/). WhatsApp’s worked best of the social media platforms for professional stuff in the past so took a gamble it’d be the same here. So far, so good. WhatsApp Community lets us have a single main community. And loads of topic-based chats people can choose to be in or not.

# What

We share and support each other in a safe space. Topics include platforms and components, programme –> product, meetups, recruitment. And stickers.

We have monthly videocall meetups and quarterly in-person meetups.
